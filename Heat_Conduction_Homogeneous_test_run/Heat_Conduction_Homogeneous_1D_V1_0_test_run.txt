Heat Conduction Homogeneous 1D V1.0 Run example

Welcome to Homogeneous 1D Heat Conduction Problems ver 2.0
DISCLAIMER: The program took a long time to run, please do be patient
This MatLab code are made for Heat Conduction Problems
The modes in this codes are: Plotting and calculating Homogenous heat conduction,
With plotting variation on time (max = 3) and N
Further optimization and range addition could be conducted with more time
The program made by M.Lucky Witjaksono
The program will be beneficial for faster system analsys
 
This programs run on the equations of: 
U(X,T) = X(x)T(t)
u(x,t) = Cn Un (x,t) = sigma Cn exp^((-(n^2)(phi^2)(a^2)(t))/(L^2)) sin(n phi x/L)
With Cn of (2/L)Integral[L to 0] f(x) sin(n phi x / L) dx
The following are the input required by the program
Rod length (meter): 50
Thermal diffusivity (alpha^2): 1
Step along the rod (min 1): 2
n Value (n>1): 10
initial conditon is a polynominal with fuction of X? yes(1),no(0): 0
Initial Temperature: 20
The user input are as follows:
Rod Length: 
    50

Thermal diffusivity (alpha^2)
     1

Initial temperature distribution [f(x)]
    20

Step along the rod:
     2

how much t(second) are wanted to be plotted (max = 3)? 3
T1 value (Seconds): 0
T2 value (Seconds): 25
T3 value (Seconds): 75
Thank you for using the program
