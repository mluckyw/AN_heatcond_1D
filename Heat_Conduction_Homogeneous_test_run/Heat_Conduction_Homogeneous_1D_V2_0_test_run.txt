Heat Conduction Homogeneous 1D V2.0 Run example


Welcome to Homogeneous 1D Heat Conduction Problems ver 2.0
This MatLab code are made for Heat Conduction Problems
The modes in this codes are: Plotting and calculating Homogenous heat conduction,
With plotting variation on time and fourier order
Further optimization and range addition could be conducted with more time
The program made by M.Lucky Witjaksono
The program will be beneficial for faster system analsys
 
This programs runs on the equations of: 
U(X,T) = X(x)T(t)
u(x,t) = Cn Un (x,t) = sigma Cn exp^((-(n^2)(phi^2)(a^2)(t))/(L^2)) sin(n phi x/L)
With Cn of (2/L)Integral[L to 0] f(x) sin(n phi x / L) dx
The following are the input required by the program
Rod length (Cm): 50
Thermal diffusivity (alpha^2): 1
Step along the rod(Cm): 2
initial conditon is a polynominal with fuction of X? yes(1),no(0): 0
Initial Temperature: 20
How many order of the fourier series that want to be analyzed(n): 3
Please input with the current order value are smaller than the next
1 order input 
Order value (n>1): 1
2 order input 
Order value (n>1): 10
3 order input 
Order value (n>1): 100
The value of CN:  
-(40*(cos(pi*n) - 1))/(n*pi)
 
Below are the general Solution equations: 
-(40*sin((pi*n*x)/50)*exp(-(555609333788003*n^2*t)/140737488355328000)*(cos(pi*n) - 1))/(n*pi)
 
How many time want to be analyzed: 3
1 Time input 
Time value: : 0
2 Time input 
Time value: : 25
3 Time input 
Time value: : 75
The program are currently calculating, Please wait
The time are depending on how many order are analyzed
Categorized plotting by time(1) or order(2): 1
